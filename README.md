*Ice ice baby, Ice ice baby, All right stop, Collaborate and listen, Ice is back with my brand new invention, Something grabs a hold of me tightly, Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly, Will it ever stop?, Yo, I don't know, Turn off the lights and I'll glow, To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal, Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle*

**Dance**
